## Case

-   NJ, a 16y/F newly diagnosed DM presented with cough x 1/52, DIB and reduced consciousness x 3/7; referral from St. Joseph's hospital, Wakiso.

::: {.incremental}
-   No chronic medical illness
-   O/E: dehydrated, moderate pallor, no oedema, ?oral thrush
-   CNS: semiconscious, GCS 9/15 (E3,M4,V2). No FNDs, PEARL, soft neck
-   others: normal
:::

## Labs

::: {.incremental}
-   Urinalysis: ketones 3+, protein 3+, glucose 3+
-   WBC 21.35, Neut 18.36, Hb 12.1, PLT 88
-   S. creatinine 351, S. urea 16.3, Na+ 150, K+ 3.7, HCO3 17.2
-   LFTs not done on admission
:::

## Diagnosis

::: {.incremental}
-   DKA
-   AKI (?due to dehydration)
-   Sepsis (pneumonia focus?)
:::

## Initial treatment

::: {.incremental}
-   IV actrapid infusion at 6IU/hr, later increased to 8IU/hr, then 12IU/hr
-   IV Ringers lactate 6L in 24 hours
-   IV KCL 20mEq in 500mls of NS stat, 40mEq on day 3
-   IV levofloxacin 500mg OD x 5/7
-   PO fluconazole 200mg OD x 2/52
:::

## Repeat Labs

::: {.incremental}
-   CBC (5 days later): WBC 16.72, Neut 14.17, Hb 7.1, PLT 160
-   RFTs (6 days later): S.cr 508, S.Ur 19.4, K+ 3.87, Na+ 146.3, Normal Mg++, Ca++ and PO3-
:::

## Transferred to Ward

-   Endocrinology after 6 days on emergency
-   First maintained at IV actrapid infusion at 6IU/hr
-   Fixed on SC lantus (glargine) 15 IU OD, SC actrapid 5 IU PB, PL and PS.
-   Maintenance IV fluids 500mls q8h

## Challenges

-   Long time to resolution of DKA
-   Lack of frequent RFTs/electrolytes
-   Labile sugars

## Diabetic Ketoacidosis

-   An acute metabolic emergency most frequently occurring in people with type 1 diabetes mellitus, but increasingly in those with type 2 as well[^1].
-   Incidence: 0--56 per 1000 person years
-   Prevalence: 0--128 per 1000 people [^2].
-   Expensive: US \~\$17 500/admission[^3].

## What is needed to make the diagnosis of DKA?

## UK criteria[^4]:

::: {.incremental}
- admission glucose of \>11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dl) or known diabetic---irrespective of the admission glucose (the 'D')
- plasma β-hydroxybutyrate concentration be ≥3.0 mmol/L, or ketonuria (\>2+ on standard urine ketone sticks) (the 'K')
- plasma bicarbonate concentration be \<15.0 mmol/L and/or a venous pH of \<7.3 (the 'A')
:::

## USA criteria[^5]:

::: {.incremental}
- a glucose concentration of \>13.9 mmol/L (250 mg/dl)
- ketones must be present (in urine or in the blood)
- metabolic acidosis must be present, with a pH of \<7.30 (measured on arterial or venous blood) and a serum bicarbonate of ≤18.0 mmol/L

## Management

### Typical deficits in DKA[^8]

[^8]: Joint British Diabetes Societies for Inpatient Care. The management of diabetic ketoacidosis in adults. Mar 2023

::: {.incremental}
-   Water: 100 ml/kg
-   Sodium: 7-10 mmol/kg
-   Chloride: 3-5 mmol/kg
-   Potassium: 3-5 mmol/kg
:::

## Insulin algorithm[^11]

[^11]: Joint British Diabetes Societies for Inpatient Care. The management of diabetic ketoacidosis in adults. Mar 2023

::: {.incremental}
-   fixed rate intravenous insulin infusion (FRIII) at 0.1 units/per kilogram body
-   50 IU soluble human insulin in 49.5 ml 0.9% sodium chloride solution (i.e. 1 unit /ml)
-   if RBS \<14 mmol/L: add 10% dextrose infusion and consider reducing the rate of intravenous insulin infusion to 0.05 units/kg/hr to avoid the risk of developing hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia
:::

## Basal insulin

::: {.incremental}
- In those already on long acting basal insulin, it should continue to be prescribed at
their usual dose.
-  In those newly diagnosed, then a long acting basal insulin should be
commenced, at a dose of 0.25 units/Kg subcutaneously once daily
:::

## Treatment targets[^12]

[^12]: Joint British Diabetes Societies for Inpatient Care. The management of diabetic ketoacidosis in adults. Mar 2023

::: {.incremental}
-   Reduction of the blood ketone concentration by 0.5 mmol/L/hour
-   Increase the venous bicarbonate by 3.0 mmol/L/hour
-   Reduce capillary blood glucose by 3.0 mmol/L/hour
-   Maintain potassium between 4.0 and 5.5 mmol/L

If not achieving targets: double FRIII?
:::

## Resolution of DKA[^13]

![](images/DKAresolution.png)

## Finally

-   Switch to subcutaneous insulin once DKA has resolved and the patient is eating and drinking
-   Start subcutaneous insulin with a meal and continue the FRIII for 30 to 60 minutes after this.
